#GO Plaid or GO Home

##About

On 2011-03-11 @cowboy decided to get some images stirred up putting @paul\_irish on plaid .. who would even think such a thing. #plaidirish

I was browsing some CSS3 Galleries, found a good one using a polaroid style desk; though of this ... and then came plaidirish.com

##Thanks

I hacked this up using html5boilerplate, and Martin Angelov's [CSS3 Lightbox Gallery][1]
##Info

Built using MacVim on jQuery, Modernizr, using CSS3
